# Livy Demo Site

A four-tab demo site showcasing [Livy's](https://x.com/livylabs) JavaScript SDK (`@livylabs/sdk`) with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, presented by [Celestia Labs](https://celestia.org/). Each tab demonstrates different use cases for [Livy's](https://x.com/livylabs) cryptographic proof verification system.

## 🚀 Features

- **Sequence Generator**: Auto-triggers on page load to generate the next number in a sequence
- **Time-Aware Service**: Calculates minutes remaining until the next hour 
- **Coin Toss Game**: Interactive coin flip with win/lose logic and animations
- **Bitcoin Price Feed**: Fetches real-time BTC→USD exchange rates

Each service call includes cryptographic proof verification to ensure data authenticity and integrity.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- [Livy](https://x.com/livylabs) API key and service IDs (see setup instructions below)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone and setup the project:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd livy-demo
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```

3. **Edit `.env.local` with your [Livy](https://x.com/livylabs) credentials:**
   ```env
   # Livy SDK Configuration
   LIVY_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   LIVY_BASE_URL=https://console.livylabs.xyz/api/proxy

   # Service IDs - One unique ID per tab function
   SEQ_SERVICE_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
   TIME_SERVICE_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
   COIN_SERVICE_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
   PRICE_SERVICE_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   **For HTTPS (recommended for Livy API):**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:https
   ```
   Then open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)

   **For regular HTTP:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

   > **Note**: Use HTTPS mode to avoid CORS issues with the [Livy](https://x.com/livylabs) API. The browser may show a security warning for the self-signed certificate - click "Advanced" and "Proceed to localhost" to continue.

## 🔧 Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required | Usage |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------|
| `LIVY_API_KEY` | Your [Livy](https://x.com/livylabs) API authentication key | ✅ Yes | Server-side only (secure) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVY_API_KEY` | API key for client display | ✅ Yes | Client-side (display only) |
| `LIVY_BASE_URL` | [Livy](https://x.com/livylabs) API base URL | ✅ Yes | Server-side |
| `SEQ_SERVICE_ID` | Service ID for sequence generation | ✅ Yes | Reference only |
| `TIME_SERVICE_ID` | Service ID for time calculations | ✅ Yes | Reference only |
| `COIN_SERVICE_ID` | Service ID for coin toss game | ✅ Yes | Reference only |
| `PRICE_SERVICE_ID` | Service ID for Bitcoin price feed | ✅ Yes | Reference only |

> **Security Note**: The actual API calls are made server-side using `LIVY_API_KEY` to avoid CORS issues and keep the API key secure. The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` version is only used for display purposes in the UI.

## 🔑 Obtaining [Livy](https://x.com/livylabs) Service IDs

1. **Sign up for [Livy](https://x.com/livylabs):**
   - Visit [Livy Labs Console](https://console.livylabs.xyz)
   - Create an account and get your API key

2. **Create Services:**
   You need to create **four separate services** in the [Livy](https://x.com/livylabs) console:
   
   - **Sequence Service**: A service that generates sequential numbers
   - **Time Service**: A service that calculates time-based values
   - **Coin Toss Service**: A service that generates random heads/tails results
   - **Price Feed Service**: A service that fetches cryptocurrency prices

3. **Copy Service IDs:**
   - Each service will have a unique UUID
   - Copy these UUIDs to your `.env.local` file

## 🎯 Tab Functionality

### 1. Sequence Tab
- **Trigger**: Automatic on component mount (`useEffect`)
- **Function**: Generates the next number in a sequence
- **Proof**: Verifies the computation was performed correctly

### 2. Time-Aware Tab  
- **Trigger**: Manual button click
- **Function**: Calculates minutes remaining until next hour
- **Proof**: Verifies the time calculation is accurate

### 3. Coin Toss Tab
- **Trigger**: Form submission (Heads/Tails choice)
- **Function**: Performs random coin flip with user prediction
- **Animation**: Spinning coin during request
- **Proof**: Verifies the randomness is truly random

### 4. Price Feed Tab
- **Trigger**: Manual button click  
- **Function**: Fetches current Bitcoin to USD exchange rate
- **Proof**: Verifies the price data hasn't been tampered with

## 🔍 Proof Verification

Each tab demonstrates [Livy's](https://x.com/livylabs) cryptographic proof system:

- **Green ✓ Valid**: The computation/data has been cryptographically verified
- **Red ✗ Invalid**: The proof verification failed
- **Raw JSON**: Shows the complete service response including proof data

## 🎨 Animations

The Coin Toss tab features CSS animations:
- **Coin flip animation**: Rotates the coin while the request is processing
- **Result display**: Shows win/lose state with colored backgrounds
- **Loading states**: Consistent loading spinners across all tabs

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Start HTTP development server
npm run dev

# Start HTTPS development server (recommended for Livy API)
npm run dev:https

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

### HTTPS Development Setup

The HTTPS development server uses self-signed certificates for local development. When you first visit `https://localhost:3000`, your browser will show a security warning. This is normal for self-signed certificates.

**To proceed:**
1. Click "Advanced" or "Show Details"
2. Click "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)" or "Accept Risk and Continue"
3. The site will load and CORS issues with the [Livy](https://x.com/livylabs) API will be resolved

The certificates are automatically generated and stored in the `certs/` directory.

## 🔧 SDK Usage Examples

### Basic Service Call
```javascript
import { runService } from '../lib/livy';

const result = await runService({
  serviceId: 'your-service-id-here'
});

console.log('Output:', result.output);
console.log('Proof Valid:', result.proofValid);
```

### Service Call with Input Parameters
```javascript
const result = await runService({
  serviceId: 'your-service-id-here',
  input: { userChoice: 'heads' }
});
```

### Error Handling
```javascript
import { SDKError } from '@livylabs/sdk';

try {
  const result = await runService({ serviceId: 'invalid-id' });
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof SDKError) {
    console.log('SDK Error Code:', err.code);
    console.log('SDK Error Message:', err.message);
  } else {
    console.log('General Error:', err.message);
  }
}
```

## 🔍 Verification Process

1. **Service Execution**: [Livy](https://x.com/livylabs) runs your service in a secure enclave
2. **Attestation Generation**: Creates cryptographic proof of execution
3. **Result Return**: Service output + attestation returned to client
4. **Verification**: Client verifies the attestation using `verifyAttestation()`
5. **Display**: UI shows both result and verification status

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Environment Variables Not Loading
- Ensure `.env.local` exists in project root
- Restart the development server after changing environment variables
- Check that variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Make sure both `LIVY_API_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVY_API_KEY` are set

### CORS Issues
- **Fixed**: Use `npm run dev:https` for HTTPS development
- API calls are proxied through Next.js API routes (`/api/livy`)
- No direct browser calls to [Livy](https://x.com/livylabs) API (bypasses CORS)

### Authentication Errors
- `INVALID_API_KEY`: Check your `LIVY_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
- `TIMEOUT_ERROR`: Service took too long (>30 seconds)
- `SERVICE_NOT_FOUND`: Verify your service IDs are correct
- Check server logs for detailed error messages

### HTTPS Certificate Warnings
- Browser will show security warning for self-signed certificates
- Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost" to continue
- This is normal for local development

### Build Errors
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check Node.js version (16.x+ required)
- Verify Tailwind CSS is properly configured
