# Price Feed TEE Function

This is a Rust command-line program designed to run in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) that fetches and certifies Bitcoin price data from the Coinbase API.

## Function Overview

The program makes an API call to Coinbase's public price endpoint, fetches the current BTC price in USD, and formats it as a certified price feed result:
- **Success**: Fetches price data, formats it nicely, and outputs both human-readable and JSON formats
- **Failure**: If the API call fails or data is invalid, the program exits with an error

## Usage

```bash
# Fetch BTC price (default)
./livy-service

# Fetch specific symbol price  
./livy-service --symbol=ETH-USD
./livy-service --symbol=ADA-USD
```

## Expected Output

### Success Case
```
BTC Price Feed Certification Function
Fetching price for symbol: BTC-USD
API endpoint: https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/BTC-USD/spot
Raw API response: base=BTC, currency=USD, amount=119122.86

âœ… CERTIFIED PRICE FEED RESULT:
Symbol: BTC-USD
Price (USD): $119122.86
Raw Price: 119122.86
Timestamp: 2025-01-22T16:30:45.123Z
Source: Coinbase API
Certified: true

JSON Output:
{
  "symbol": "BTC-USD",
  "price_usd": 119122.86,
  "raw_price": "119122.86",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-22T16:30:45.123Z",
  "source": "Coinbase API",
  "certified": true
}

ðŸŽ‰ Price feed successfully certified and notarized in TEE!
```

### Failure Case (Invalid Symbol)
```
BTC Price Feed Certification Function
Fetching price for symbol: INVALID
API endpoint: https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/INVALID/spot
API request failed with status: 404 Not Found
```

## Technical Details

- **API Endpoint**: `https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/BTC-USD/spot`
- **HTTP Client**: Uses `reqwest` for async HTTP requests
- **Response Format**: Parses Coinbase JSON response: `{"data":{"amount":"119122.86","base":"BTC","currency":"USD"}}`
- **Output Formats**: Both human-readable display and structured JSON
- **Timestamp**: Adds UTC timestamp for when the price was certified
- **Error Handling**: Validates API response and price parsing

## Use Cases in TEE

This demonstrates how TEE can be used to:
- **Certify external data sources** (price feeds, market data)
- **Create trusted oracles** for blockchain applications  
- **Notarize API responses** with verifiable timestamps
- **Provide secure price feeds** for DeFi applications

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Dependencies

- `reqwest` - HTTP client for API calls
- `serde` + `serde_json` - JSON parsing and serialization
- `tokio` - Async runtime
- `chrono` - Timestamp generation

## Usage in TEE Environment

The compiled binary `livy-service` makes HTTP requests to external APIs and certifies the responses within the trusted execution environment, providing verifiable proof that the data came from the specified source at a specific time.
